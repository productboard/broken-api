## The Broken API

You've been teaching Little Timmy about JavaScript and NodeJS, but he hasn't had much luck and everything keeps breaking! 

When he started you wrote some tests that he was supposed to make pass, but he needs more help. The code he has writen is contained in `./routes/` can you help him fix it?

Don't let Little Timmy down, he's counting on you!
